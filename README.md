# Snake
Classic snake game from the childhood!
Even in early elementary school, I used to play snake for hours each day on my cousin's gameboy, trying to get a higher score.
I am glad to put my version of this game in the repository.
In the future, I plan to add an user interface at the start so user could choose the speed of the snake(difficulty) and the colour of the food, and see rankings for recent high scores.
